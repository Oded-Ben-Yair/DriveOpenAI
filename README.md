This powerful tool enables you to ask intuitive, conversational questions about your Google Drive documents and receive precise, context-aware answers powered by OpenAI's advanced GPT-4 model.

## What Makes DriveOpenAI Special?
DriveOpenAI uniquely combines advanced semantic understanding with seamless integration into your Google Drive, empowering you to:

- **Effortlessly search your Drive:** Get precise answers using true semantic search.
- **Leverage conversation memory:** Enjoy natural, context-aware interactions.
- **Focus on specific documents:** Target queries for specific document insights.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional for container deployment)

### Local Development Setup
Clone and navigate into the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DriveOpenAI.git
cd DriveOpenAI

# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Running Locally

Ensure you have a `.env` file set up in your `backend` directory with the required API keys and environment variables:

```env
PORT=3000
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<Your Google Client ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YourSecret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
OPENAI_COMPLETION_MODEL=gpt-4
```

### Start Backend & Frontend

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run serve
```

## Docker Deployment

To deploy DriveOpenAI using Docker, use the following command from your project's root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This builds and starts both frontend (accessible at `localhost:8080`) and backend (port 3000).

## Firebase Authentication Setup

Ensure your Firebase Authentication settings are correctly configured:

- **Authorized Redirect URI:** Add your Firebase app's callback URL.
- Ensure the Google OAuth credentials (Client ID & Secret) match your `.env`.

## UX/UI Enhancements Implemented

- **Improved welcome experience:** Clear and engaging introduction highlighting key features.
- **Enhanced error handling:** Intuitive and user-friendly error states with actionable feedback.
- **Simplified filtering & pagination:** User-friendly date filtering and file management.
- **Streamlined AI queries:** Dynamic loading states and clear feedback for indexing and AI interactions.

## Security Best Practices

- Store sensitive credentials in `.env` file (never commit sensitive keys to GitHub).
- Use HTTPS in production environments.
- Regularly rotate your OpenAI and Google API credentials.

## Future Roadmap

- **Enhanced models:** Experimenting with advanced OpenAI models like GPT-4o to improve response quality and speed.
- **Real-time updates:** Instant indexing progress updates and improved user feedback.
- **Enhanced file management:** Batch file indexing and real-time indexing updates.
